            <h2>Why NFTs?</h2>
            <p>
                The Blockchain Technology provides unique Proof of Ownership - in a completely transparent ecosystem.
                NFTs cannot be copied and each one has a unique identifier, which lets you see which address owns your
                crafts and how often it changes hands.

            <h2>Hidden Magic</h2>
            <p>
                Our Ecosystem is based on the Ethereum Layer 2 Protocol Loopring. It uses Cryptography to verify each
                transaction and your account balance. Most existing projects that focus on trading Music NFTs are build
                on the Polygon Sidechain or Ethereums Layer 1.

                Loopring provides cheaper Gas Fees (costs of using the Network - about 100x cheaper!) than Ethereums
                Mainnet and a better Security Method than Polygon.
